# LibraryApp

This is my third project i made in c# during my 4th study semester.

I'd never make anything like this again but it was pretty nice as a one of my first big projects with UI.

I was kinda proud of myself back then :D

The goal of the project was to make Windows Form App that will use WCF services.

I have used 8 services which i hosted on my custom server and 3 Microsoft SQL databases.

Application I have created is basically fully functional library with both admin, guest and user panel.

I used data scrapping to create my books dataset. There are:
- over 34k books
- in 48 languages
- in over 900 genres

Books prices can be shown in almost every available currency that i have from NBP API.
